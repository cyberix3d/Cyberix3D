# Cyberix3D
The Cyberix3D Game Maker is an online tool for creating 3D and 2D games for the web, mobile, and desktop. The current technology of the Cyberix3D Engine is Flash Player and we have created this Github repository for creating a new version of the Cyberix3D Engine that will support HTML5 instead of Flash and also support desktop and mobile versions.

The Cyberix3D Engine will take an XML file and run it as a game.
The XML can be generated through any text editor or through a graphics editor with a user-friendly GUI.
